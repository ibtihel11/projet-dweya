# projet-dweya

This project was created during my first year at university as part of my introduction to web development. It was an opportunity for me to learn and practice the fundamentals of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## About the Project

The project is a simple web page that demonstrates:
- Basic HTML page structure
- CSS styling and layout techniques
- Basic JavaScript interactions
It was built to apply the concepts I learned in my initial web development modules.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
This project showcases my first steps into front-end development and reflects my early progress during my learning journey.  It isn't a production-ready application but a learning exercise demonstrating what I was able to build after completing introductory coursework.
